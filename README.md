You are able to view all employees, all employees by department, all roles, all company departments, or the total utilized budget used by a particular department. You may also add or delete an employee, role, or department at any time.  Other features include, updating an employee's role or updating a company's role. One important note is if you delete a role or department, all employees associated with that deleted role or department will also be removed! Be careful!
